Gradient Mechanics offers GPU accelerated utilities for loading and preprocessing
images and videos. The library wraps several NVIDIA components so that decoding
and transforms can be executed directly on the GPU.

* Start with [Getting Started](getting_started.md) to set up the development
  environment.
* See [Architecture](architecture.md) for an overview of the underlying
  libraries and how they are used.
